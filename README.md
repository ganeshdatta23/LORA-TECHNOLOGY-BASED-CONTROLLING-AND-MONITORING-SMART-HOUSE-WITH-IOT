## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔁 **Real-time State Detection**  
  Uses state functions to detect and reflect the current status of each smart device.

- 📡 **LoRa-based Wireless Communication**  
  Efficient long-range, low-power communication without the need for constant internet access.

- 🌍 **Static IP Allocation**  
  Ensures consistent addressing and seamless communication between devices.

- 📱 **Android App Integration**  
  Provides a simple UI/UX for remote control and monitoring.

- 💰 **Cost-effective Design**  
  Utilizes affordable components while ensuring robustness and scalability.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- **LoRa SX1278 Modules**
- **ESP8266 / NodeMCU**
- **Arduino IDE**
- **Blink IoT App**
- **IoT Protocols (HTTP/MQTT, etc.)**

---

## 📲 How It Works

1. Devices are connected to microcontrollers equipped with **LoRa modules**.
2. Each device communicates its status to a **central controller**.
3. The **Android app** sends commands and receives device states using **static IPs** over LoRa.
4. The state detection logic ensures **accurate synchronization** between app and hardware.
